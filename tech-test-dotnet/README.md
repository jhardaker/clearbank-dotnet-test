### Notes

Further consideration. I think that the payment scheme validation could be migrated to use something like fluent validator is i had more time.

I would have liked to have built out the integration tests a bit more too to actually test the back up data store.

I would also have liked to add customer exceptions for various points the code hits. Such as account not found, or when checking to see if a payment is valid.
